# WEDE-project
My client asked for a website to display their products and services.
They are a tech repair and resell company, led by a group of qualified technicians who are ready to assist with whatever repairs are needed.
They specialize in cellphone, laptop, and computer repairs, their skills applicable on any and every major brand.
For the design, I added five different pages: the home page, the service page, an information page, a catalogue, a contact page and enquiries page.
All the products in the catalogue are certified and in perfect, like-new condition at an affordable price for work and school alike.
